/**
 * From https://web.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/frbr-wemi-music#item:
 *
 * <p>A work is realized by an expression, which is embodied in a manifestation, which is
 * exemplified by an item.
 *
 * <p>An Item is the actual copy of the manifestation that expression takes that is owned by a
 * person or corporate body. It is the only absolutely concrete entity in the FRBR model
 *
 * <p>An item can consist of several distinct physical objects, such as a box set of CDs, or two
 * separately bound volumes with no common sleeve/box that were issued and sold together. Both are
 * considered to be one item.
 *
 * <p>Each copy of Music &amp; Arts 1995 pressing of the recording of Die Zauberfl√∂te by Mozart July
 * 27, 1949 performance by the Konzertvereinigung Wiener Staatsopernchor is an item.
 *
 * <p>Each copy of Sony Classical's 2005 release of the June 10, 14-16, 1955 J.S. Bach's Goldberg
 * variations performed by Glen Gould is an item.
 *
 * <p>Attributes of an item: provenance, location, condition, access restrictions, identifier (if it
 * has one), etc.
 *
 * <p>Dublin Core Fields of an item:
 * https://dublincore.org/resources/userguide/publishing_metadata/#Properties_of_the_legacy_namespace
