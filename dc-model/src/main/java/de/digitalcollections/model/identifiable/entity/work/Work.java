/**
 * From https://web.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/frbr-wemi-music#work:
 *
 * <p>A work is realized by an expression, which is embodied in a manifestation, which is
 * exemplified by an item.
 *
 * <p>A Work is an abstract idea or distinct intellectual creation that is created by a person or
 * corporate body. "A work is defined as a 'distinct intellectual or artistic creation,' is an
 * abstract entity in that there is no single physically or linguistically fixed object representing
 * that work. Rather, a work is the artistic and intellectual commonality of one or more resources
 * as they are multiplied through translation, abridgment, revision, or any other process which does
 * not substantially alter core content."
 *
 * <p>Attributes of a work: title, date, identifier (if it has one), intended audience, form of
 * work, medium of performance, numeric designation, key, etc.
 *
 * <p>°Author or composer is not an attribute for work or expression, because such information is
 * treated in FRBR as a relationship between the work or expression and a person or corporate body."
 *
 * <p>Die Zauberflöte by Mozart and J.S. Bach's Goldberg variations, apart from all ways of
 * expressing them, are works.
